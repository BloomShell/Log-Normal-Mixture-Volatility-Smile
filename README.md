# lognormal-mixture
This project implements the LogNormal-mixture model for option pricing, based on the paper "Lognormal-mixture dynamics and calibration to market volatility smiles" by Damiano Brigo, Fabio Mercurio, and Francesco Rapisarda. The model and methods are encapsulated in a Python class and are used to calculate implied volatilities and option prices.

## Introduction
The LogNormalMixture model is used to fit market volatility smiles by modeling the underlying asset price as a mixture of lognormal distributions. This project provides the tools to calculate the net-present-value (NPV) of options and their implied volatilities using this model.
